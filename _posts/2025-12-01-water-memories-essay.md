Memory is not solid. It flows, shifts, and transforms with each recollection. Like water, it takes the shape of the container we pour it into—our current emotional state, our present context, our evolving understanding of ourselves.

**Water Memories**, the December 2025 release from the Hemio Monthly Series, attempts to capture this fluid nature of remembering through minimalist piano composition.

## Compositional Approach

The piece centers on a flowing arpeggio pattern that serves as both foundation and current—a stream of consciousness that carries fragmentary melodic materials. Rather than building toward dramatic climaxes, the composition explores subtle transformation through:

- **Rhythmic fluidity**: The pulse remains constant, but the subdivision of time shifts, creating a sense of drift
- **Harmonic ambiguity**: Chords emerge and dissolve before fully resolving, mirroring how memories remain incomplete
- **Textural layering**: Multiple streams of arpeggios interweave, like currents in water meeting and separating

## The Six-Minute Decision

In an era where streaming economics push toward 2-3 minute songs, Water Memories runs 6 minutes and 24 seconds. This isn't defiance for its own sake—it's structural necessity.

Memory doesn't reveal itself quickly. To create the sensation of immersion, of sinking into recollection, the listener needs time to:
1. Settle into the pattern
2. Notice the subtle variations
3. Experience the accumulation of small changes into significant transformation

Shorter would be a description of water. Longer becomes the experience of being in water.

## Influences and Inspirations

This piece draws from:

- **Steve Reich's** exploration of phasing and gradual process
- **Erik Satie's** understanding that repetition can be contemplative rather than monotonous
- **Max Richter's** ability to find emotional depth in minimalist structures

But also from non-musical sources:
- The way light moves underwater
- How childhood memories feel more like impressions than facts
- The Japanese concept of *mono no aware*—the pathos of transient things

## Performance Notes

Onure's interpretation brings an essential humanity to the mechanical patterns. The slight variations in touch, the breathing between phrases, the subtle rubato that a human performer brings—these imperfections are what make the piece feel like actual memory rather than a photograph of memory.

## Technical Details

**Key:** [Add specific key]  
**Time Signature:** Primarily 4/4 with moments of metric ambiguity  
**Tempo:** ♩ = 84  
**Form:** Through-composed with recurring motifs  
**Duration:** 6:24

The score utilizes extended arpeggios spanning over two octaves, requiring careful pedaling to maintain clarity while achieving the desired wash of sound.

## Listening Recommendations

Water Memories rewards different listening contexts:

- **Active listening**: Follow the subtle harmonic shifts and motivic development
- **Background/ambient**: Let it create atmosphere without demanding attention  
- **Meditation**: Use the repetitive patterns as a focus for contemplation

I find it works particularly well during:
- Early morning with coffee
- Late evening reflection
- Rainy days
- Moments when you want to be alone with your thoughts

## Final Thoughts

Every composition is an attempt to capture something ineffable. With Water Memories, I wanted to evoke not a specific memory, but the act of remembering itself—the way the past shimmers and shifts, always there but never quite graspable, like trying to hold water in your hands.

The piece succeeds if it creates a space where your own memories can surface and flow.
