Memory is not solid. It flows, shifts, and transforms with each recollection. Like water, it takes the shape of the container we pour it into—our current emotional state, our present context, our evolving understanding of ourselves.

**Water Memories**, the December 2025 release from the Hemio Monthly Series, attempts to capture this fluid nature of remembering through minimalist piano composition.

## Compositional Approach

The piece centers on a flowing arpeggio pattern that serves as both foundation and current—a stream of consciousness that carries fragmentary melodic materials.

## The Six-Minute Decision

In an era where streaming economics push toward 2-3 minute songs, Water Memories runs 6 minutes and 24 seconds. This isn't defiance for its own sake—it's structural necessity.

Memory doesn't reveal itself quickly. To create the sensation of immersion, the listener needs time to settle into the pattern, notice the subtle variations, and experience the accumulation of small changes.
