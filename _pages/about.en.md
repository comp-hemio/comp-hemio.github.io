## Hello, I'm Hemio, a composer.

I started studying music to answer the question, "Why is music beautiful?" I believe that music goes beyond a mere combination of sounds; it moves emotions and communicates what words sometimes cannot. If the soul had a language, it would undoubtedly be "music."

I see music not as something that belongs solely to the composer but to everyone who listens. The worldview of a piece of music expands infinitely with the number of listeners. I truly believe that the more people experience the music, the more diverse its meaning becomes. 

As my favorite composer, Arvo Pärt, said:

> "I would compare my music with white light which contains all the colors. Only a prism can extract the colors and make them visible to us. The prism could be the consciousness of the listener."

The wider the spectrum of each listener, the richer the world of the music becomes.

I believe the ultimate goal of all art is empathy. I sincerely hope that the beauty I perceive resonates with you as well. I look forward to seeing how my music interacts with your emotions, shaping your own personal stories.

## Professions

**Composer** — I express emotions through music  
**Developer** — I work on AI and backend technologies, bringing logical structures to life  
**Traveler** — My experiences broaden my perspective, constantly inspiring my music and ideas

## Hemio Monthly Series

Through the Hemio Monthly Series, I release one new piano piece each month via DistroKid to all major streaming platforms. These contemporary classical and minimalist compositions explore themes of time, memory, nature, and existence.

In an era where streaming platforms push for shorter songs, I deliberately compose pieces that are 6+ minutes long. This allows the music to breathe, develop, and create an immersive experience for the listener.

## Musical Influences

My work is deeply influenced by **Philip Glass**, **Steve Reich**, **Erik Satie**, **Arvo Pärt**, **Max Richter**, and **Nils Frahm**.

## Collaborators

My compositions are brought to life by talented pianists including **Onure** and others.

## Reach

The music has reached listeners in 144 countries across all major platforms, generating nearly 60,000 plays.
