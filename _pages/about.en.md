## Contemporary Piano Composer

Hemio creates contemporary classical and minimalist piano compositions that explore themes of time, memory, nature, and existence. Through the **Hemio Monthly Series**, a new piano piece is released every month via DistroKid to all major streaming platforms.

## Musical Influences

My work is deeply influenced by:

- **Philip Glass** - Repetitive structures and gradual transformation
- **Steve Reich** - Phasing patterns and rhythmic exploration  
- **Erik Satie** - Simplicity and atmospheric composition
- **Max Richter** - Contemporary classical minimalism
- **Nils Frahm** - Modern piano textures and intimacy

## Compositional Philosophy

I believe in creating music that provides space for contemplation. In an era where streaming platforms push for shorter songs, I deliberately compose pieces that are 6+ minutes long. This allows the music to breathe, develop, and create an immersive experience for the listener.

## The Creative Process

Each piece begins with a concept—often drawn from nature, seasons, or philosophical ideas. I develop these through careful exploration of rhythmic patterns, harmonic progression, and textural development.

I write analytical essays about each composition, exploring the musical theory, compositional choices, and philosophical themes behind the work.

## Collaborators

My compositions are brought to life by talented pianists including **Onure** and others.

## Distribution

All compositions are released through **DistroKid** to Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, and 100+ other platforms. The music has reached listeners in 144 countries, generating nearly 60,000 plays.
