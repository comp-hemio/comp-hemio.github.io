## Contemporary Piano Composer

Hemio creates contemporary classical and minimalist piano compositions that explore themes of time, memory, nature, and existence. Through the **Hemio Monthly Series**, a new piano piece is released every month via DistroKid to all major streaming platforms.

## Musical Influences

My work is deeply influenced by:

- **Philip Glass** - Repetitive structures and gradual transformation
- **Steve Reich** - Phasing patterns and rhythmic exploration  
- **Erik Satie** - Simplicity and atmospheric composition
- **Max Richter** - Contemporary classical minimalism
- **Nils Frahm** - Modern piano textures and intimacy

## Compositional Philosophy

I believe in creating music that provides space for contemplation. In an era where streaming platforms push for shorter songs, I deliberately compose pieces that are 6+ minutes long. This allows the music to breathe, develop, and create an immersive experience for the listener.

My compositions blend:
- Minimalist repetition with subtle variation
- Contemporary classical harmony
- Natural and seasonal themes
- Philosophical and existential questions

## The Creative Process

Each piece begins with a concept—often drawn from nature, seasons, or philosophical ideas. I develop these through careful exploration of:

- Rhythmic patterns and time signatures (including 5/8, 7/8)
- Harmonic progression and modulation
- Textural development through arpeggios and ostinatos
- Dynamic contrast and emotional arc

I write analytical essays about each composition on my blog, exploring the musical theory, compositional choices, and philosophical themes behind the work.

## Collaborators

My compositions are brought to life by talented pianists:

- **Onure** - Principal performer for the Monthly Series
- Additional performers for special projects

## Distribution & Performance

All compositions are released through **DistroKid** to:
- Spotify
- Apple Music
- YouTube Music
- Amazon Music
- And 100+ other platforms

The music has reached listeners in 144 countries, generating nearly 60,000 plays.

## Beyond Music

I also maintain a philosophical blog where I write analytical essays about composition, music theory, and the intersection of art and existence. These writings explore not just the technical aspects of music-making, but the deeper questions of why we create and what music means.

## Background

Before focusing on composition, I founded a startup in Seoul, an experience that taught me resilience, commitment, and the value of maintaining artistic integrity even in difficult circumstances. That period of challenge informs the emotional depth and authenticity I bring to my musical work.
